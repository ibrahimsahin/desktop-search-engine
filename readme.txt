Designing  and implementing  a  mini  search  engine  which  will run as a desktop application
Basically,  an  information  retrieval  system  processes the  documents (only  text  files  in  a 
specified directory for our experiment)and store their content (i.e. words / tokens) in the 
data structures that you selected (in information retrieval, this phase is called indexing).
Next, for every input query, the systemwill process the query and search its keywords in 
the  documents, using the previously implemented data structures and an algorithm (will 
be explained below).(this phase is called  retrieval)For each such query, you will have 
to display the documents that satisfy the query.(MINI SEARCH ENGINE)
